## SELECT Basics
### Introducing the `world` table of countries
1. 
The example uses a `WHERE` clause to show the population of 'France'. Note that strings (pieces of text that are data) should be in 'single quotes';

Modify it to show the population of Germany
```sql
SELECT population FROM world
  WHERE name = 'Germany';
```
### Scandinavia
2.
Checking a list The word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list. The example shows the name and population for the countries 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'India' and 'China'.

Show the name and the population for 'Sweden', 'Norway' and 'Denmark'.
```sql
SELECT name, population FROM world
  WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');
```
### Just the right size
3.
Which countries are not too small and not too big? `BETWEEN` allows range checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values). The example below shows countries with an area of 250,000-300,000 sq. km. Modify it to show the country and the area for countries with an area between 200,000 and 250,000.

```sql
SELECT name, area FROM world
  WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000;
```
## SELECT from WORLD Tutorial
### Introduction
1.
Read the notes about this table. Observe the result of running this SQL command to show the name, continent and population of all countries.

```sql
SELECT name, continent, population FROM world;
```
### Large Countries
2.
How to use WHERE to filter records. Show the name for the countries that have a population of at least 200 million. 200 million is 200000000, there are eight zeros.

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
WHERE population > 200000000;
```
### Per capita GDP
3.
Give the name and the per capita GDP for those countries with a population of at least 200 million.

```sql
SELECT name,gdp/population FROM world WHERE population > 200000000;
```
### South America In millions
4.
Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.

```sql
SELECT name,population/1000000 FROM world WHERE continent = 'South America';
```
### France, Germany, Italy
5.
Show the `name` and `population` for France, Germany, Italy

```sql
SELECT name,population FROM world WHERE name IN ('France','Germany','Italy');
```
### United
6.
Show the countries which have a name that includes the word 'United'

```sql
SELECT name FROM world WHERE name LIKE  '%United%';
```
### Two ways to be big
7.
Two ways to be big: A country is big if it has an area of more than 3 million sq km or it has a population of more than 250 million.

Show the countries that are big by area or big by population. Show name, population and area.

```sql 
SELECT name,population,area FROM world WHERE population > 250000000 OR area > 3000000;
```
### One or the other (but not both)
8.
Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area or big by population but not both. Show name, population and area.

* Australia has a big area but a small population, it should be **included**.
- Indonesia has a big population but a small area, it should be **included**.
- China has a big population and big area, it should be **excluded**.
+ United Kingdom has a small population and a small area, it should be **excluded**.

```sql
SELECT name,population,area FROM world WHERE (area < 3000000 AND population > 250000000) OR (area > 3000000 and population < 250000000);
```
### Rounding
9.
Show the `name` and `population` in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the `continent` 'South America'. Use the `ROUND` function to show the values to two decimal places.

For South America show population in millions and GDP in billions both to **2** decimal places.

```sql
SELECT name, ROUND(population/1000000, 2), ROUND(gdp/1000000000, 2) FROM world WHERE continent = 'South America';
```
### Trillion dollar economies
10.
Show the name and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). Round this value to the nearest 1000.

Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000.

```sql
SELECT name, ROUND(gdp/population, -3) FROM world WHERE gdp > 1000000000000;
```
### Name and capital have the same length
11.
```sql
SELECT name, capital FROM world WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital);
```
### Matching name and capital
12.
```sql
SELECT name, capital FROM world WHERE LEFT(name, 1) = LEFT(capital, 1) AND name <> capital;
```
### All the vowels
13.
```sql
SELECT name
   FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%a%'
AND name LIKE '%e%'
AND name LIKE '%i%'
AND name LIKE '%o%'
AND name LIKE '%u%'
AND name NOT LIKE '% %';
```

## SELF JOIN

### How many stops are in the database.
1.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stops
```
### Find the id value for the stop 'Craiglockhart'
2.
```sql
SELECT stops.id FROM stops
WHERE name = 'Craiglockhart'
```
### Give the id and the name for the stops on the '4' 'LRT' service.
3.
```sql
SELECT id, name FROM stops
JOIN route ON stops.id = route.stop
WHERE num = 4 AND company = 'LRT'
```
### Routes and stops(1)
4.
The query shown gives the number of routes that visit either London Road (149) or Craiglockhart (53). Run the query and notice the two services that link these stops have a count of 2. Add a HAVING clause to restrict the output to these two routes.

```sql
SELECT company, num, COUNT(*)
FROM route WHERE stop=149 OR stop=53
GROUP BY company, num
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```
### Routes and stops(2)
5.
Execute the self join shown and observe that b.stop gives all the places you can get to from Craiglockhart, without changing routes. Change the query so that it shows the services from Craiglockhart to London Road.

```sql
SELECT a.company, a.num, a.stop, b.stop
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
WHERE a.stop=53 AND b.stop = (
SELECT id FROM stops
WHERE name = 'London Road'
)
```
### Routes and stops(3)
6.
The query shown is similar to the previous one, however by joining two copies of the stops table we can refer to stops by name rather than by number. Change the query so that the services between 'Craiglockhart' and 'London Road' are shown. If you are tired of these places try 'Fairmilehead' against 'Tollcross'

```sql
SELECT a.company, a.num, stopa.name, stopb.name
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart' AND stopb.name = 'London Road'
```
### Using Self `JOIN`
7.
Give a list of all the services which connect stops 115 and 137 ('Haymarket' and 'Leith')

```sql
SELECT a.company, a.num
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name='Haymarket' AND stopb.name = 'Leith'
GROUP BY company, num
```
### Working with self join
8.
Give a list of the services which connect the stops 'Craiglockhart' and 'Tollcross'

```sql
SELECT a.company, a.num
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
  (a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
  JOIN stops stopa ON (a.stop=stopa.id)
  JOIN stops stopb ON (b.stop=stopb.id)
WHERE stopa.name='Craiglockhart' AND stopb.name = 'Tollcross'
GROUP BY company, num
```
### Using `JOIN` 
9.
Give a distinct list of the stops which may be reached from 'Craiglockhart' by taking one bus, including 'Craiglockhart' itself, offered by the LRT company. Include the company and bus no. of the relevant services.

```sql
SELECT stopb.name, a.company, a.num
FROM route a JOIN route b ON
(a.company=b.company AND a.num=b.num)
JOIN stops stopa ON stopa.id = a.stop
JOIN stops stopb ON stopb.id = b.stop
WHERE a.company = 'LRT' AND stopa.name = 'Craiglockhart'
GROUP BY company, num, name
ORDER BY stopb.name ASC
```
